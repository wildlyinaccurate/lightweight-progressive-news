# Lightweight responsive news

An attempt at building a super-lightweight progressive news webapp for the BBC News hackday July 2016.

This repository contains snapshots of pages generated by some code which I'm unable to open source (sorry!)

## [News front page](https://wildlyinaccurate.com/lightweight-progressive-news/index.html)

#### Highlights

 * Higher quality lead image (natural resolution versus 200px scaled up)
 * Ability to lazy-load all images
 * 7KB document size versus 36KB on live (**80% smaller**)
 * 27KB total size versus 300KB on live (**91% smaller**)
 * 100ms first paint versus 250ms on live (**60% faster**)
 * 460ms load time versus 900ms on live (**50% faster**)
 * Much lower CPU profile than live

**Lightweight CPU profile**

#### Highlights

 * Enables a cheap alternative to dubbing video
